                <p>Thank you for your interest in the membership of TAWAKKUL COOPERATIVE SOCIETY LIMITED (Reg. No. KWS/16948). Kindly note the following key points to guide your choice as expressed above before submitting your form.<br><br>
                    1. Your application fee is a one-time payment.<br><br>
                    2. The desired membership category which is the ultimate expectation of the Society from all members is the Category A+ (Corporate or Individual).<br><br>
                    3. Corporate Members can only be admitted into the Cooperative on Category A+ Membership.<br><br>
                    4. Individual Members on other Categories are considered to be of Partial Membership Status, yet to attain the Full Membership Status with limitations in terms of benefits, opportunities and shareholdings.<br><br>
                    5. While an Individual applicant who registers as a Full Member (Category A+) pays the application fee in full, individual members on other Categories only pay partial application fee corresponding to their membership category. For this reason, they pay for Change of Membership Category when they move to a higher Category in the sum which is the balance between the lower category and the higher category till they move to Category A+. So, this is the reason for the disparity in application fees as reflected in the Table above.<br><br>
                    6. The GPIS Package is a Special Package which requires that interested members specially subscribes to it for them to enjoy it. Special Subscription fee applies depending on the subscription duration. For Two Years Duration Subscription, the fee is N1000: 00 (One Thousand Naira) for individual members and N5, 000: 00k (Five Thousand Naira) for corporate members. The Life Time Subscription fee for individual members is N5, 000: 00k (Five Thousand Naira). While it is N10, 000: 00k (Ten Thousand Naira) corporate members. When investment opportunities come requiring engagement of the Supportive Investment Fund, the Savings in the GPIS will be given prior consideration before other Savings. The GPIS Fund will also be given priority when there is an opportunity for any Collective Funding Investment Project (CFIP) or Special Investment Fund Subscription by the Society such as construction of estates or shops for sales; etc. When the proposed Tawakkul Microfinance Bank is floated, the GPIS Subscribers shall have prior consideration for shareholding in the Bank and their Savings shall be transferred to the Banks to become pioneer customers.<br><br>
                    7. Maqbarah, Ta'awun, Welfare-Waqf and Contingency Packages are schemes aimed at the welfare of the members. Subscribers to these Packages set out to enjoy some special welfare services from the Society. The Maqbarah (Cemetery) Investment stands to bring benefits to the subscribers when eventually floated.<br><br>
                    8. Other Packages are in the form of Convenience Savings and Project Savings; though all the Savings are eligible to be engaged in investment as Supportive Investment Fund (SIF).<br><br></p>
